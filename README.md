# battleship-game
This is a [battleship game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) that you will play against an AI computer. Battleship project is made for my Data structure and Algorithm course. [Phaser3](https://phaser.io/) is the JS game framework that I used to create that game.

You can try out this game from here https://battleship-project-dsa.herokuapp.com/.

Thanks to the authors of this blog https://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/. He helped me to figure out a good strategy for my AI computer to predict the next move. The algorithm which I use is the Probability Density Function whose idea is described specifically by the author.
